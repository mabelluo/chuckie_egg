Chuckie Egg is a modern day replication of the original video game that was released in 1983. 
This version has several levels where the farmer (you, the player) dodge chickens and collect eggs within the allotted quantity of time, without losing more than three lives. The graphics of the game are improved without losing the timeless fashion of the original retro art style.
